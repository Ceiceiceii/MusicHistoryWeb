                      Sergei Rachmaninoff was <mark>a Russian composer, virtuoso pianist, and conductor</mark> who lived from 1873 to 1943. He is widely regarded as one of the best pianists of his time, and as a composer, <mark>one of the last great Romantic figures in Russian classical music</mark>. Although influenced early on by Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers, Rachmaninoff's work became known for its unique <mark>song-like melodies, expressiveness, and rich orchestral colors</mark>. Throughout his work, Rachmaninoff's piano skills were prominently featured and he was dedicated to exploring the expressive and technical possibilities of the instrument.</p>

                      Rachmaninoff was born into a musical family and started playing the piano at four years old. He received musical training from Anton Arensky and Sergei Taneyev at the Moscow Conservatory, where he graduated in 1892 after composing several piano and orchestral pieces. After the failure of his Symphony No. 1 premiere in 1897, he fell into a deep depression for four years and produced little work until successful therapy allowed him to complete <mark>his highly acclaimed Piano Concerto No. 2</mark> in 1901. Over the next sixteen years, he conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre, moved to Dresden, Germany, and embarked on his first tour of the United States.

                 Rachmaninoff was a prolific composer, with a large output of works for piano, orchestra, and piano and orchestra. Rachmaninoff's most popular works include the Second and Third piano concertos, the Second symphony, and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Here are some of his most notable pieces:</p>

                  Rachmaninoff's style initially bore Tchaikovsky's influence, but he developed a more distinctive tone in the mid-1890s, exemplified by the original features in his First Symphony such as brutal gestures and sweeping lyricism After its poor reception, <mark>his style evolved towards broadly lyrical and passionate melodies</mark>, and his orchestration became subtler and more varied. He often used <mark>unusually spaced chords to create bell-like sounds and drew inspiration from Russian Orthodox chants</mark>. Rachmaninoff was skilled in counterpoint and fugal writing, often using the Dies Irae motif and employing chromatic counterpoint. He underwent further changes in his style before leaving Russia, focusing more on coloring in Op. 38 songs and Op. 39 Études-Tableaux. He continued to evolve in the 1930s with more textural clarity and abrasive chromatic harmony, as seen in Variations on a Theme of Corelli. Despite his evolving style, some of his most beautiful melodies appear in the Third Symphony, Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, and Symphonic Dances.
